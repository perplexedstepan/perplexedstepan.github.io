## [](#header-2)Educational Technology

Educational technology is something that I've always enjoyed using. As a certified [Google Trainer](https://edudirectory.withgoogle.com/profiles/4802333711007744), I have a big interest in helping others learn how to use technology both in teaching and in studying. Technology is something that none of us can escape these days, so it's important to know how to use it responsibly and in a useful way.
