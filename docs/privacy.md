# [](#Privacy-Consciousness)Staying Privacy Conscious in a Data Harvesting World

I have attempted to compile a list of resources and tools for individuals to consult and use in order to exhert more control over their privacy online.

## [](#Privacy-Importance)Why is Privacy Important?

Many in this day and age may believe that privacy online is irrelevant. Why do I need to be so private online? It's not like I'm doing anything wrong or illegal, right? Well, yes and no.

When it comes to privacy online, it's not a matter of hiding possible illicit activities (which for the record, I do not approve). However, Naomi Brockwell did it best when she said, "Goverments come and go, but your data is forever." By this, it means that governments change over time and what may have been perfectly legal and free to do one day may end up being illegal the next - particularly now with AI legislation in the works in the United States. However, your data will be stored for a very, very long time. In fact, now it will likely remain even after you have long since gone.

There is absolutely nothing wrong when it comes to wanting to keep your online habits private. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, or other big tech giants may be monitoring your data and traffic for all sorts of reasons. By finding ways to circumnavigate them, you keep your online traffic to yourself, sharing it only with those that you feel it worth sharing with (i.e. the webhost).
