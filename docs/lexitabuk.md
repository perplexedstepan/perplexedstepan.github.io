# LexiTabuk

## [](#Introduction) Introduction

LexiTabuk started as a project for my Master's degree in IT. It is an user-friendly app designed to facilitate language learning and communication. Specifically tailored for language students enrolled in the University of Tabuk's first-year English program, the app bridges the gap between classroom learning and practical usage. LexiTabuk offers a unique blend of interactive features to enhance pronunciation, comprehension, and vocabulary skills. It's an ideal tool for students in who wish to practice and improve their skills outside the classroom in a low-stakes learning environment.

### Open the App

To begin using the app, locate the app on your phone's screen. Tap on it and accept the permissions allowing the app to access your microphone. (The request to accept the permissions should only appear on the first launch.)

### Select Your Class

You will be prompted to choose your class every time that you open the app, but if you want to change your class without restarting the app, you can do so using the `Select Class` button.

### Select the Phrase

After you select your topic, you can choose the word or phrase to hear it spoken through your phone's speakers. You may select the words as many times as you would like. You can also scroll to see additional words and phrases in the topic.

### How to Use the App in the Best Way

For the most optimal results in your English language learning, it is recommended to do the following:
1. Listen to the word or phrase by tapping on it. (If you are searching for the word or phrase from your Student Companion, you might need to scroll in order to find it.)
2. Press `Record` and record yourself speaking by using your phone's microphone.
3. Press `Stop Recording` and then press `Listen` in order to hear your pronunciation. Was it similar to what you heard from your phone?
4. Check your pronunciation with the word you were practicing with by tapping on the word again.
5. Now try using that word in a sentence.
6. When you feel like you've mastered the word or phrase, continue to the next one.
