## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Research Question Formulation

The notebook begins by guiding users through the process of crafting a well-structured research question. It prompts for key components such as population, variables, and constructs.

### 3. Methodology Design

While the specific details of this section are proprietary, the notebook guides researchers through:

- Selecting and justifying a research paradigm
- Operationalizing variables
- Establishing construct validity
- Addressing potential rebuttals to methodological choices

### 4. Results Analysis

The notebook provides robust tools for analyzing research data, including:

1. Importing and processing data
2. Performing statistical tests
3. Generating visualizations
4. Interpreting findings in the context of the research question

## Getting Started

To begin using the RUA Jupyter Notebook:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook on your system
2. Download the RUA template
3. Open the template in Jupyter Notebook
4. Follow the guided prompts to build your research argument

```python
# Example of how the RUA notebook might generate a research question
def generate_research_question(population, independent_var, dependent_var):
    return f"How does {independent_var} affect {dependent_var} in {population}?"

# Usage
question = generate_research_question("ESL students", "task-based learning", "vocabulary retention")
print(question)
