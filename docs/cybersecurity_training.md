In November of 2023, I created a Virtual Escape Room for a cybersecurity training program which uses concepts related to phishing, passwords, IR policies, and social engineering attacks.

To play, you can [go to the Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/cs-escaperoom/home) which hosts it.

If you want to find information about its documentation and how to implement it in your own Cybersecurity Training program, you can [go to its Github repository page](https://github.com/perplexedstepan/cybersecurityescaperoom).
